- 2025-10-11. Code. Updated tonclib to current DevkitPro libtonc. This includes:
  - Minor fixes to certain functions
  - Using the (u)int(8|16|32)_t for base types now. This unfortunately means s32/u32 are `long int` instead of basic `int` now, which results in many type problems. But it is better this way. Honest.
  - Rename `tonclib` to `libtonc`. 't is a shame, but that's how libraries are generally named in the GCC universe.
  - Fixing PATH defines in makefiles, since `gbafix` is elsewhere.

- 2025-08-10. Text. Fixed so many things in the text itself.
  - Added deprecation banner.
  - Converted to utf8.
  - Better font and font size. When I started 800x600 was the Big Thing. That's ... no longer the case.
  - Fixed column alignment on tables. `<col>` hasn't worked for that in ages, probably.
  - Converted autonum script to python.
  
- 2025-07-27. Code. 
  - Removed Programmer's Notepad and ancient VS project files.
  - m7_ex. Fixed `border` grit file (was missing a palette-size param) and changed the horizon scrolling multiplier.
  - libtonc. `tte_types.s` had a `TTC_cmdProc` that doesn't actually exist O_O;;
  - libtonc. Better `chr4c_drawg_b1cts()`
  

- 2025-10-16. Code.
  - nocash hook fixes.
